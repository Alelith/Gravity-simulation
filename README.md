# Gravity Simulation

This is a Unity project created to learn and practice using Unity DOTS (Data-Oriented Technology Stack). The main goal of this project is to simulate Newtonian gravity using DOTS for efficient, scalable entity management and physics calculations.

## Features
- Simulates Newtonian gravity between entities.
- Built with Unity DOTS for performance and scalability.
- Designed for educational purposes and experimentation with DOTS concepts.

## Requirements
- **Unity 6 Editor** (project is not compatible with earlier versions)
- DOTS packages installed (Entities, Burst, Jobs, etc.)

## How to Run
This project does not include a standalone build. It can only be played and tested within the Unity 6 Editor:
1. Open the project in Unity 6.
2. Enter Play mode to observe the gravity simulation in action.

## Purpose
This project is intended for learning and practicing Unity DOTS. It demonstrates how to implement physics-based interactions (Newtonian gravity) using DOTS systems and components.
